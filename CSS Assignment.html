    <h2>Module-4:CSS and CSS3</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-1) What are the benefits of using CSS?</strong></p>
    <p><b>Advantages of CSS</b></p>
    <p><b>1.Separation of Content and Style</b></p>
    <p>One of the most significant advantages of CSS is its ability to separate content from presentation. This 
       separation enhances the maintainability of web pages as changes to the styling can be made without altering 
       the underlying <u>HTML Structure</u>. This also promotes a cleaner, more organized codebase.</p>
    <p><b>2. Consistency</b></p>
    <p>CSS enables consistent styling across an entire website or multiple pages. This is one of the many advantages 
       of using CSS. By creating a single external CSS file and linking it to multiple web pages, you ensure a uniform 
       look and feel. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier to update styling elements globally.</p>
    <p><b>3. Faster Loading Times</b></p>
    <p>External CSS files can be cached by web browsers, allowing them to load faster on subsequent visits. This 
       results in a better user experience, especially for returning visitors.</p>
    <p><b>4. Responsive Design</b></p>
    <p>With CSS, you can create <u>responsive web designs</u> that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This is 
       another main one among advantages of cascading style sheets. This is crucial in the era of mobile browsing, 
       as it ensures your website looks and functions well on various platforms.</p>
    <p><b>5. Ease of Maintenance</b></p>
    <p>Modifying the appearance of a website is more straightforward with CSS. You can quickly make changes to fonts, 
       colors, and layouts by updating a few lines of code in the CSS file, rather than manually editing each <u>HTML 
       element.</u></p>
    <p><b>6. Accessibility</b></p>
    <p>CSS allows developers to improve web accessibility by controlling the presentation of content.Properly structured 
       CSS can make a website more accessible to individuals with disabilities, enhancing inclusivity.</p>
    <p><b>7. Print-Friendly Pages</b></p>
    <p>CSS can be used to create printer-friendly versions of web pages. This is particularly useful for e-commerce 
       websites, blogs, or any content-heavy sites where users might want to print articles or product information.</p>
    <p><b>8. Global Styling</b></p>
    <p>External CSS files can be linked to multiple web pages, making it easy to apply consistent styling across an 
       entire website. This saves time and ensures a cohesive design.</p>
    <p><b>9. Efficient Updates</b></p>
    <p>When you need to update the styling of a website, you can make changes in one central CSS file. This means that 
       updates are applied universally, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.</p>
    <p><b>10. Animations and Effects</b></p>
    <p>CSS allows for animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience. You can create interactive elements 
       without relying on JavaScript or other <u>scripting languages.</u></p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-2)What are the disadvantages of CSS?</strong></p>
    <p><b>1. Browser Compatibility</b></p>
    <p>CSS may render differently in various web browsers, leading to inconsistencies in the visual presentation. 
       Developers often need to write browser-specific CSS code or use vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility.</p>
    <p><b>2. Learning Curve</b></p>
    <p>One among the main disadvantages of cascading style sheets is that while it is essential for web development, 
       it can be complex, especially for beginners. Mastering CSS requires understanding selectors, properties, values, 
       and the box model, which can be overwhelming.</p>
    <p><b>3. Lack of Security</b></p>
    <p>CSS itself does not offer security features, and it can be vulnerable to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
       when used inappropriately. Developers must be cautious when implementing CSS to prevent security risks.</p>
    <p><b>4. Limited Layout Control</b></p>
    <p>CSS has limitations when it comes to controlling complex layouts. Achieving specific layouts, such as equal-height 
       columns, can be challenging without resorting to workarounds or additional technologies like Flexbox or Grid.</p>
    <p><b>5. Performance Impact</b></p>
    <p>Extensive or poorly optimized CSS files can slow down page load times. It's essential to minimize and optimize 
       CSS to maintain optimal website performance.</p>
    <p><b>6. Overriding Styles</b></p>
    <p>The "cascading" nature of CSS can sometimes lead to unexpected styling conflicts. Specificity and the order in 
       which styles are applied can result in unintended consequences.</p>
    <p><b>7. Maintenance Challenges</b></p>
    <p>As websites grow and evolve, maintaining and refactoring CSS can become complex and time-consuming. It's crucial 
       to follow best practices and use naming conventions to keep styles manageable.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-3)What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</strong></p>
    <p>CSS2 and CSS3 are both stylesheet languages used to control the presentation of web pages. CSS2 was released in 
       1998, and CSS3 is still under development.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the key differences between CSS2 and CSS3:</p>
    <list>
        <ul>
            <li><b>New features:</b> CSS3 adds a number of new features to CSS2, including:</li>
            <li><b>Flexbox:</b>Flexbox is a layout module that makes it easier to create responsive layouts.</li>
            <li><b>Grid:</b>Grid is a layout module that provides more control over the layout of elements on a web page.</li>
            <li><b>Animations:</b> CSS3 adds support for animations, which can be used to create more dynamic web pages.</li>
            <li><b>Transitions:</b>CSS3 adds support for transitions, which can be used to create smooth transitions between states of an element.</li>
            <li><b>Custom properties:</b>CSS3 adds support for custom properties, which can be used to create reusable styles.</li>
            <li><b>Improved support for media queries:</b>CSS3 improves the support for media queries, which can be used to adjust the layout of a web page for different screen sizes.</li>
            <li><b>Better performance:</b>CSS3 code is typically more efficient than CSS2 code, which can lead to faster page load times.</li>
        </ul>
    </list>
    <p>Overall, CSS3 is a more powerful and versatile stylesheet language than CSS2. It offers a number of new features
       that make it easier to create responsive, dynamic, and visually appealing web pages.</p>
    <p>However, it is important to note that not all browsers support all CSS3 features. For example, some older browsers 
       may not support the flexbox and grid layout modules. It is therefore important to test your web pages on a variety 
       of browsers before publishing them.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-4)Name a few CSS style components.</strong></p>
    <p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:</p>
    <list>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Properties:</b> These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify.For example,font-size,width,background-color.</li>
            <li><b>Values:</b> Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.</li>
        </ol>
    </list>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-5)What do you understand by CSS opacity?</strong></p>
    <p>The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element 
       is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</p>
    <p>The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 
       0 is completely transparent.</p>
    <p>Like this Example.</p>
    <div class="a">
        <div class="b">No Effect on this box</div>
        <div class="c">Effect on this box</div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-6)How can the background color of an element be changed?</strong></p>
    <p>The background-color property sets the background color of an element.</p>
    <p>The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).</p>
    <p>Like this Example.</p>
    <p class="d">This  is Example.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-7)How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</strong></p>
    <p>The background-repeat property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.</p>
    <p>By default, a background-image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.</p>
    <p>Like this Example.</p>
    <div class="e"></div>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-8)What is the use of the background-position property?</strong></p>
    <p>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.</p>
    <p>Like this Example.</p>
    <div class="f"></div>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Q-9)Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</strong></p>
    <p>The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.</p>
    <table class="g">
      <tr>
         <th>Value</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>scroll</td>
         <td>The background image will scroll with the page. This is default</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>fixed</td>
         <td>The background image will not scroll with the page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>local</td>
         <td>The background image will scroll with the element's contents</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-10)Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</strong></p>
   <p>There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a 
      complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</p>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-11)How to center block elements using CSS1?</strong></p>
   <p>To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the &lt;center&gt; tag. All the elements within 
      the &lt;center&gt; tag will be centrally aligned.</p>
   <table class="h">
      <tr>
         <td></td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-12)How to maintain the CSS specifications?</strong></p>
   <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
   <p>Even though every browser supports CSS, there are many inconsistencies in the supported specification version.</p>
   <p>Some browsers even have their own implementation of the specification and have proprietary (vendor) prefixes.</p>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-13)What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</strong></p>
   <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways.</p>
   <table class="i">
      <tr>
         <th>Way</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Inline</td>
         <td>by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Internal</td>
         <td> by using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; section</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>External</td>
         <td>by using a &lt;link&gt; element to link to an external CSS file</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-14)What is embedded style sheets?</strong></p>
   <p>An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document.</p>
   <p>It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element.</p>
   <p>Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.</p>
   <p>It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. </p>
   <p>This is done by embedding the &lt;style&gt;,&lt;/style&gt; tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.</p>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-15)What are the external style sheets?</strong></p>
   <p>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage.</p>
   <p>Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.</p>
   <p>The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-16)What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</strong></p>
   <p><b>Advantages of external style sheets</b></p>
   <p>With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file.</p>
   <p>In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.</p>
   <p>In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.</p>
   <p><b>Disadvantages of external style sheets</b></p>
   <p>An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.</p>
   <p>The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.</p>
   <p>While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.</p>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-17)What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</strong></p>
   <p>A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.</p>
   <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>
   <table class="j">
      <tr>
         <th>Selecters</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>#id</td>
         <td>Selects the element with id="firstname"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>.class</td>
         <td>Selects all elements with class="intro"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>*</td>
         <td>Selects all elements</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>elements</td>
         <td>Selects all group elements</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>element element</td>
         <td>Selects all &lt;p&gt; elements inside  &lt;div&gt; elements</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>element>element</td>
         <td>Selects all &lt;p&gt; elements where the parent is a &lt;div&gt; element</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>element+element</td>
         <td>Selects the first &lt;p&gt; element that are placed immediately after &lt;div&gt; elements</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>element1~element2</td>
         <td>Selects every &lt;ul&gt; element that are preceded by a &lt;p&gt; element</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-18)What are the media types allowed by CSS?</strong></p>
   <p>if the specified media type matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query.</p>
   <table class="k">
      <tr>
         <th>Values</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>all</td>
         <td>Used for all media type devices</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>print</td>
         <td>Used for printers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>screen</td>
         <td>Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>speech</td>
         <td>Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>Q-19)What is the rule set?</strong></p>
   <p>A CSS ruleset is various affirmations to various pieces or elements of the document.</p>
   <p>The objective is to apply a bunch of properties for certain distinct qualities to a solitary, or a particular arrangement of components in the connected HTML page. </p>
   <p>Visualization of CSS Ruleset:</p>
   <div class="l"></div>
